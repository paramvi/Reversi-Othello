Reversi-Othello
===============

this is the game othello/Reversi i implemented in my AI course. I implemented aplha-beta and minimax search techniques.

To run this programme, follow the following steps:

compile main.cpp as "g++ main.cpp -std=c++98" on c++11 compiler, if compiler is c++98, then simply as "g++ main.cpp".
Then hust run. If you are on linux environment, run like "./a.out" and if you are on windows, run it like "<output>.exe". Generally <output> is "a" only.

I will be updating more information about this programme shortly.
