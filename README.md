Reversi-Othello
===============

this is the game othello/Reversi i implemented in my AI course. I implemented aplha-beta and minimax search techniques.

To run this programme, follow the following steps:

compile main.cpp as "g++ main.cpp -std=c++98" on c++11 compiler, if compiler is c++98, then simply as "g++ main.cpp".
Then just run. If you are on linux environment, run like "./a.out" and if you are on windows, run it like "output.exe". Generally "output" is "a" only.

After running the program, it will ask you to the choose minimax search technique or alpha-beta technique. For lower DEPTH(<=4) you can choose any of the techniques but for higher DEPTH, it is recommended to choose alpha-beta technique. This is so because minimax technique takes too much time to execute the move.

I will be updating more information about this programme shortly.
